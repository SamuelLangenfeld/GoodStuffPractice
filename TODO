MVP ->
  clicking on a destination gives you cheap tickets, dates, and airline carrier to google. Flight number too?
  Minimum departure date is 2 weeks out
  Use production data -> DC origin.
  Show airline carrier on offers.
  Show country of origin and/or region on flight cards.
  Cleanup code, organize. Run ChatGPT over code, see if it could do better.
  Halfway decent UI. Check accessibility, make it pretty.
  Better error handling. Display errors/loading on UI.

STRETCH ->
  Create AWS lambda functions to handle Amadeus API calls
  Allow for searching cheapest date for destination
  Allow user to store desired locations. Create a db to hold user data.
  Store airport codes, names, country and region codes/names in db instead of Amadeus API calls.
  Create lambda functions to check ticket prices 1/day and store them per user.
  Allow user to change origin.
  Allow user to click and navigate to google search page with query params based on flight.
  Allow user to see cheapest dates for desired locations.
  Email user 1/week with random cheap deals as well as cheap deals for desired locations.
  Log errors.
  Log API calls. Put in guard rails so I'm not hit with crazy bill.
  Use CSS framework or UI component library to make it look nice.
